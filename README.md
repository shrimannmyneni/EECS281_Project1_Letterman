# EECS281_Project1_Letterman
Word Transformation Path Finder from EECS 281 @ UofMichigan. This project involves transforming words using BFS and DFS, covering custom data structures, command line parsing, and text dictionary handling. Key topics include efficient word storage, reading/writing dictionaries, and word transformation techniques.

### EECS 281: Project 1 - Letterman Reboot (Path Finding)

### Overview
This project involves upgrading Lettermanâ€™s ability to change one word into another by making specific modifications. The goal is to navigate from a starting word to an ending word using a series of valid transformations while adhering to given rules and dictionary constraints.

### Project Goals
- Implement Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS)
- Use custom data structures for efficient word storage and access
- Handle command line inputs with `getopt_long()`
- Read, store, access, and write text dictionaries
- Implement various word transformation modes
